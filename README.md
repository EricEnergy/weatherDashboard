## User Story
As A traveler
I Want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
So That I can plan a trip accordingly


How did I deliver this?

* I used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

* Used AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

* The app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* The app displays the following under current weather conditions:

  * City

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity

  * Wind speed

  * UV index

* Includes a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city. 

* Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity
